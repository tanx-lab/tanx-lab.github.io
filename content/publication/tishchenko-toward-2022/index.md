abstract: We present some preliminary work toward bi-directional in situ visualization
  and analysis of blood flow considering blood cell suspensions and dynamic moving
  walls to mimic the clot growth process. The work is implemented through integrating
  multiple open source packages including fluid flow solver, blood cells, and in situ
  visualization and analysis. It shows that in situ visualization enables us to examine
  and process the simulation results without writing data to files. In addition, preliminary
  results on bidirectional steering (still in progress) can accelerate engineers to
  explore the complicated stress environment experienced by clots of different sizes.
