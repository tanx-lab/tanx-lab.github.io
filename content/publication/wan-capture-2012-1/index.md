abstract: Early detection and isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTC) can enable
  better prognosis for cancer patients. A Hele-Shaw device with aptamer functionalized
  glass beads is designed, modeled, and fabricated to efficiently isolate cancer cells
  from a cellular mixture. The glass beads are functionalized with anti-epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) aptamer and sit in ordered array of pits in polydimethylsiloxane
  (PDMS) channel. A PDMS encapsulation is then used to cover the channel and to flow
  through cell solution. The beads capture cancer cells from flowing solution depicting
  high selectivity. The cell-bound glass beads are then re-suspended from the device
  surface followed by the release of 92% cells from glass beads using combination
  of soft shaking and anti-sense RNA. This approach ensures that the cells remain
  in native state and undisturbed during capture, isolation and elution for post-analysis.
  The use of highly selective anti-EGFR aptamer with the glass beads in an array and
  subsequent release of cells with antisense molecules provide multiple levels of
  binding and release opportunities that can help in defining new classes of CTC enumeration
  devices.
