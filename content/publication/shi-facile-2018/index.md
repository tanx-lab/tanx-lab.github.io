abstract: A facile method for generation of tumor spheroids in large quantity with
  controllable size and high uniformity is presented. HCT-116 cells are used as a
  model cell line. Individual tumor cells are sparsely seeded onto petri-dishes. After
  a few days of growth, separated cellular islets are formed and then detached by
  dispase while maintaining their sheet shape. These detached cell sheets are transferred
  to dispase-doped media under orbital shaking conditions. Assisted by the shear flow
  under shaking and inhibition of cell-to-extracellular matrix junctions by dispase,
  the cell sheets curl up and eventually tumor spheroids are formed. The average size
  of the spheroids can be controlled by tuning the cell sheet culturing period and
  spheroid shaking period. The uniformity can be controlled by a set of sieves which
  were home-made using stainless steel meshes. Since this method is based on simple
  petri-dish cell culturing and shaking, it is rather facile for forming tumor spheroids
  with no theoretical quantity limit. This method has been used to form HeLa, A431
  and U87 MG tumor spheroids and application of the formed tumor spheroids in drug
  screening is also demonstrated. The viability, 3D structure, and necrosis of the
  spheroids are characterized.
