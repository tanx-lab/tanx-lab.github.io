abstract: Fluid–solid coupling is commonly used but sometimes expensive in large-scale
  simulations for fluid dynamics. Conventional numerical methods rely on high performance
  computers and parallel computing techniques to accelerate simulations. In this work,
  a lightweight immersed boundary-physics informed machine learning model is proposed
  for the fluid–solid coupling based on the physical framework of multi-direct forcing
  of the immersed boundary method. Two dimensional flows past a static cylinder are
  adopted as case studies for the drag. It shows close agreements of drag coefficient
  among simulations conducted by the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM),
  immersed boundary-physics informed neural network model (IB-PINN), and data from
  references. No-slip boundary conditions around the cylinder boundaries are closely
  satisfied and the time consumed by the machine learning model is reduced by 38.5%
  compared with IB-LBM, which demonstrates that the machine learning approach is robust,
  fast, and accurate.
