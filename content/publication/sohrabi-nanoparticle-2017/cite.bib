 abstract = {Quantitative understanding of nanoparticles delivery in a complex vascular networks is very challenging because it involves interplay of transport, hydrodynamic force, and multivalent interactions across different scales. Heterogeneous pulmonary network includes up to 16 generations of vessels in its arterial tree. Modeling the complete pulmonary vascular system in 3D is computationally unrealistic. To save computational cost, a model reconstructed from MRI scanned images is cut into an arbitrary pathway consisting of the upper 4-generations. The remaining generations are represented by an artificially rebuilt pathway. Physiological data such as branch information and connectivity matrix are used for geometry reconstruction. A lumped model is used to model the flow resistance of the branches that are cut off from the truncated pathway. Moreover, since the nanoparticle binding process is stochastic in nature, a binding probability function is used to simplify the carrier attachment and detachment processes. The stitched realistic and artificial geometries coupled with the lumped model at the unresolved outlets are used to resolve the flow field within the truncated arterial tree. Then, the biodistribution of 200nm, 700nm and 2µm particles at different vessel generations is studied. At the end, 0.2–0.5% nanocarrier deposition is predicted during one time passage of drug carriers through pulmonary vascular tree. Our truncated approach enabled us to efﬁciently model hemodynamics and accordingly particle distribution in a complex 3D vasculature providing a simple, yet efficient predictive tool to study drug delivery at organ level.},
