abstract: Quantitative understanding of nanoparticles delivery in a complex vascular
  networks is very challenging because it involves interplay of transport, hydrodynamic
  force, and multivalent interactions across different scales. Heterogeneous pulmonary
  network includes up to 16 generations of vessels in its arterial tree. Modeling
  the complete pulmonary vascular system in 3D is computationally unrealistic. To
  save computational cost, a model reconstructed from MRI scanned images is cut into
  an arbitrary pathway consisting of the upper 4-generations. The remaining generations
  are represented by an artificially rebuilt pathway. Physiological data such as branch
  information and connectivity matrix are used for geometry reconstruction. A lumped
  model is used to model the flow resistance of the branches that are cut off from
  the truncated pathway. Moreover, since the nanoparticle binding process is stochastic
  in nature, a binding probability function is used to simplify the carrier attachment
  and detachment processes. The stitched realistic and artificial geometries coupled
  with the lumped model at the unresolved outlets are used to resolve the flow field
  within the truncated arterial tree. Then, the biodistribution of 200nm, 700nm and
  2µm particles at different vessel generations is studied. At the end, 0.2–0.5% nanocarrier
  deposition is predicted during one time passage of drug carriers through pulmonary
  vascular tree. Our truncated approach enabled us to efﬁciently model hemodynamics
  and accordingly particle distribution in a complex 3D vasculature providing a simple,
  yet efficient predictive tool to study drug delivery at organ level.
