abstract: Isolating cells of interest from a heterogeneous population has been of
  critical importance in biological studies and clinical applications. In this study,
  a novel approach is proposed for utilizing an active ciliary system in microfluidic
  devices to separate particles based on their physical properties. In this approach,
  the bottom of the microchannel is covered with an equally spaced cilia array of
  various patterns which is actuated by an external stimuli. 3D simulations are carried
  out to study cilia-particle interaction and isolation dynamic in a microfluidic
  channel. It is observed that these elastic hair-like filaments can influence particle's
  trajectories differently depending on their biophysical properties. This modeling
  study utilizes immersed boundary method coupled with the lattice Boltzmann method.
  Soft particles and cilia are implemented through the spring connected network model
  and point-particle scheme, respectively. It is shown that cilia array with proper
  stimulation is able to continuously and non-destructively separate cells into subpopulations
  based on their size, shape, and stiffness. At the end, a design map for fabrication
  of a programmable microfluidic device capable of isolating various subpopulations
  of cells is developed. This biocompatible, label-free design can separate cells/soft
  microparticles with high throughput which can greatly complement existing separation
  technologies.
