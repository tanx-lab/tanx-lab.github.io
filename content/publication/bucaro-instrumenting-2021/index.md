abstract: Blood flow simulations have important applications in engineering and medicine,
  requiring visualization and analysis for both fluid (blood plasma) and solid (cells).
  Recent advances in blood flow simulations highlight the need of a more efficient
  analysis of large data sets. Traditionally, analysis is performed after a simulation
  is completed, and any changes of simulation settings require running the simulation
  again. With bi-directional in situ analysis we aim to solve this problem by allowing
  manipulation of simulation parameters in run time. In this project, we describe
  our early steps toward this goal and present the in situ instrumentation of two
  coupled codes for blood flow simulation using the SENSEI in situ framework.
