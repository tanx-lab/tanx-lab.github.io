abstract: Fish swimming is a prominent research focus in biomimetic hydrodynamics,
  and studying the surface stress dynamic of fish contributes to the shape and structural
  design of robotic fish as well as the energy-efficient control of schooling robotic
  fish. Traditional research primarily relies on conventional numerical simulations
  that involve mesh generation and testing. However, the deformation of a swimming
  fish significantly impacts local grids, and the uncertainties in mesh structure
  reduce simulation accuracy. To address these challenges, this study employs the
  open-source computational fluid dynamics solver Palabos, which is based on the lattice
  Boltzmann method (LBM), to investigate the stress dynamics on fish surfaces. The
  immersed boundary method algorithm is coupled with LBM and enhanced with a multi-direct
  forcing scheme to improve precision and effectively handle fluid–solid interactions.
  Simulations reveal the spatial variations of shear traction on the fish surface.
  Furthermore, dynamic mode decomposition is applied to analyze the temporal and spatial
  evolution of shear traction distribution. The results indicate that under steady
  undulation, high-speed regions and areas of high vorticity occur where the fish's
  head and tail make contact with the water surface. Despite changes in tail-beating
  frequency, the overall flow field and vortex shedding pattern remain consistent.
  Further stress analysis reveals that shear traction oscillates regularly, with its
  amplitude varying along the fish's body surface. During swimming, shear traction
  is concentrated at the tail tip and the fish's head edge, regions that also feature
  large vortices in the fluid field. Based on the shear traction distribution, it
  can be inferred that the primary source of propulsion originates from the fish's
  back. The findings provide a theoretical foundation and reference points for the
  design of bionic fish exoskeletons, strategies for reducing surface drag, and fluid
  field optimization. This study elucidates the mechanisms underlying surface shear
  traction distribution on fish, offering valuable insight for related research.
