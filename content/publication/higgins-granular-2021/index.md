abstract: Predictability of consistent granular flow is critical in many industries.
  This exploration of behavior in a conveyor apparatus aims to fill a gap in knowledge
  of achieving a uniform mass flow rate by correlating local velocity profile data
  with summative mass measurements in both experiments and simulations. Differences
  between the two types of flow measurements indicate unwanted energy dissipation.
  In experiments, image data was collected for uniformly-sized particles in the bottom-driven
  flow conveyor belt system for which edge velocity profiles could be produced to
  measure local shear rates and estimate mass flow. These velocity relationships under
  different speeds of the belt and varied outlet sizes are compared to shear rates
  from gravity driven flow. Similarity in the linear profile transitioning to an exponential
  decay are observed but at shear rates substantially lower than dilated, free-surface
  flows. Simulations were conducted using LIGGGHTS discrete element model framework
  using the same dimensions for the conveyor system and particle sizes. Results show
  unique three-dimensional velocity profiles can produce similar mass flow rate behavior.
  The work continues to demonstrate computational models of granular flows with experimental
  validations can be used to evaluate customized designs in industrial applications,
  such as feeding unsteady biomass conversion reactors. Future work can be developed
  to evaluate granular materials that have random distribution of sizes, aspect ratios,
  and orientation.
