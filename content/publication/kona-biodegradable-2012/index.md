abstract: This research aims to develop targeted nanoparticles as drug carriers to
  the injured arterial wall under fluid shear stress by mimicking the natural binding
  ability of platelets via interactions of glycoprotein Ib-alpha (GPIbα) of platelets
  with P-selectin of damaged endothelial cells (ECs) and/or with von Willebrand factor
  (vWF) of the subendothelium. Drug-loaded poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
  nanoparticles were formulated using a standard emulsion method and conjugated with
  glycocalicin, the external fraction of platelet GPIbα, via carbodiimide chemistry.
  Surface-coated and cellular uptake studies in ECs showed that conjugation of PLGA
  nanoparticles, with GPIb, significantly increased nanoparticle adhesion to P-selectin-
  and vWF-coated surfaces as well as nanoparticle uptake by activated ECs under fluid
  shear stresses. In addition, effects of nanoparticle size and shear stress on adhesion
  efficiency were characterized through parallel flow chamber studies. The observed
  decrease in bound nanoparticle density with increased particle sizes and shear stresses
  is also explained through a computational model. Our results demonstrate that the
  GPIb-conjugated PLGA nanoparticles can be used as a targeted and controlled drug
  delivery system under flow conditions at the site of vascular injury.
