abstract: The deformability of cells has been used as a biomarker to detect circulating
  tumor cells from patient blood sample using microfluidic devices with microscale
  pores. Successful separations of circulating tumor cells from a blood sample require
  careful design of the micropore size and applied pressure. This paper presented
  a parametric study of cell squeezing through micropores with different size and
  pressure. Different membrane compressibility modulus was used to characterize the
  deformability of varying cancer cells. Nucleus effect was also considered. It shows
  that the cell translocation time through the micropore increases with cell membrane
  compressibility modulus and nucleus stiffness. Particularly, it increases exponentially
  as the micropore diameter or pressure decreases. The simulation results such as
  the cell squeezing shape and translocation time agree well with experimental observations.
  The simulation results suggest that special care should be taken in applying Laplaceâ€“Young
  equation to microfluidic design due to the nonuniform stress distribution and membrane
  bending resistance.
