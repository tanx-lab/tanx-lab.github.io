abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) are emerging as promising carrier platforms for targeted
  drug delivery and imaging probes. To evaluate the delivery efficiency, it is important
  to predict the distribution of NPs within blood vessels. NP size, shape and vessel
  geometry are believed to influence its biodistribution in circulation. Whereas,
  the effect of size on nanoparticle distribution has been extensively studied, little
  is known about the shape and vessel geometry effect. This paper describes a computational
  model for NP transport and distribution in a mimetic branched blood vessel using
  combined NP Brownian dynamics and continuum fluid mechanics approaches. The simulation
  results indicate that NPs with smaller size and rod shape have higher binding capabilities
  as a result of smaller drag force and larger contact area. The binding dynamics
  of rod-shaped NPs is found to be dependent on their initial contact points and orientations
  to the wall. Higher concentration of NPs is observed in the bifurcation area compared
  to the straight section of the branched vessel. Moreover, it is found that Péclet
  number plays an important role in determining the fraction of NPs deposited in the
  branched region and the straight section. Simulation results also indicate that
  NP binding decreases with increased shear rate. Dynamic NP re-distribution from
  low to high shear rates is observed due to the non-uniform shear stress distribution
  over the branched channel. This study would provide valuable information for NP
  distribution in a complex vascular network.
