abstract: This document presents research on real-time visualization and interactive
  steering for high-performance computing simulations. By creating intuitive web interfaces,
  researchers can visualize and steer their simulations without deep programming expertise
  or knowledge of the underlying codebase. Our work bridges Ascent, a flyweight in
  situ visualization library, with Trame, a web-based framework for developing interactive
  visualization tools. This simplifies the integration of real-time visualization
  and steering into new and existing high-performance computing applications. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach with three science drivers that use large-scale
  production simulations.
