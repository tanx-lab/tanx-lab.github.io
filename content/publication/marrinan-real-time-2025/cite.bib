 abstract = {This document presents research on real-time visualization and interactive steering for high-performance computing simulations. By creating intuitive web interfaces, researchers can visualize and steer their simulations without deep programming expertise or knowledge of the underlying codebase. Our work bridges Ascent, a flyweight in situ visualization library, with Trame, a web-based framework for developing interactive visualization tools. This simplifies the integration of real-time visualization and steering into new and existing high-performance computing applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with three science drivers that use large-scale production simulations.},
