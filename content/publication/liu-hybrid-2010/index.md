abstract: Nanoparticle targeted delivery in vascular system involves the interplay
  of transport, hydrodynamic force, and multivalent interactions with targeted biosurfaces.
  Current theoretical studies in nanoparticle therapeutic delivery are limited to
  nanoparticle suspensions in a Newtonian fluid without blood cells [1â€“3]. However,
  blood is a complex biological fluid made of components such as red blood cells (RBC),
  monocytes, platelets, proteins, etc. The existence of blood cells in the core region
  of blood streams might change the nanoparticle dispersion and binding through cell-nanoparticle
  interaction. It is thus important to understand how blood cells influence nanoparticles
  motion and binding.
