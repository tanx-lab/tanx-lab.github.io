abstract: Liposomes as drug vehicles have advantages, such as payload protection,
  tunable carrying capacity and improved biodistribution. However, due to the dysfunction
  of targeting moieties and payload loss during preparation, immunoliposomes have
  yet to be favoured in commercial manufacturing. Here we report a chemical modification-free
  biophysical approach for producing immunoliposomes in one step through the self-assembly
  of a chimeric nanobody (cNB) into liposome bilayers. cNB consists of a nanobody
  against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a flexible peptide linker
  and a hydrophobic single transmembrane domain. We determined that 64% of therapeutic
  compounds can be encapsulated into 100-nm liposomes, and up to 2,500 cNBs can be
  anchored on liposomal membranes without steric hindrance under facile conditions.
  Subsequently, we demonstrate that drug-loaded immunoliposomes increase cytotoxicity
  on HER2-overexpressing cancer cell lines by 10- to 20-fold, inhibit the growth of
  xenograft tumours by 3.4-fold and improve survival by more than twofold.
