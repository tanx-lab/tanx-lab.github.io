abstract: In this work, a discrete element method was used to investigate pellet-shaped
  granular flow within a bottom-driven conveyor belt as a function of the exit area;
  the size of the opening fluctuates as a result of the conveyor flights passing through
  the exit. Simulations and experiments were evaluated to demonstrate that greater
  uniformity in mass flow rates are possible with smaller opening area. However, the
  limitation in exit size due to the flights passing through the exit causes some
  circulation within the hopper reducing the efficiency of the transport process.
  Meanwhile, larger openings resulted in gravity dominated flow rather than control
  via the belt speed. Frequency analysis of the fluctuations of the mass flow rate
  indicate correlation with the velocity of the flights on the belt but with less
  presence of low frequency modes at larger exit heights. Simulations also considered
  the orientation of the 3:1 aspect ratio pellets showing the pattern of plug flow
  near the moving belt transitioning to pseudo-stationary material on top of the storage
  hopper. The overlapping performance of experiments confirmed the predictive nature
  of simulations to aid design of future poly-disperse systems of non-uniform materials.
