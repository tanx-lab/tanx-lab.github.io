abstract: Prediction of nanoparticle (NP) distribution in a vasculature involves transport
  phenomena at various scales and is crucial for the evaluation of NP delivery efficiency.
  A combined particulate and continuum model is developed to model NP transport and
  delivery processes. In the particulate model ligand–receptor binding kinetics is
  coupled with Brownian dynamics to study NP binding on a microscale. An analytical
  formula is derived to link molecular level binding parameters to particulate level
  adhesion and detachment rates. The obtained NP adhesion rates are then coupled with
  a convection–diffusion–reaction model to study NP transport and delivery at macroscale.
  The binding results of the continuum model agree well with those from the particulate
  model. The effects of shear rate, particle size and vascular geometry on NP adhesion
  are investigated. Attachment rates predicted by the analytical formula also agree
  reasonably well with the experimental data reported in literature. The developed
  coupled model that links ligand–receptor binding dynamics to NP adhesion rate along
  with macroscale transport and delivery processes may serve as a faster evaluation
  and prediction tool to determine NP distribution in complex vascular networks.
