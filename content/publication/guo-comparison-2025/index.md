abstract: IntroductionPublic health data analysis is critical to understanding disease
  trends. Existing analysis methods struggle with the complexity of public health
  data, which includes both location and time factors. Machine learning offers powerful
  tools but can be computationally expensive and require specialized knowledge. Dynamic
  mode decomposition (DMD) is an alternative that offers efficient analysis with fewer
  resources. This study explores applying DMD in public health using lung cancer data
  and compares it with other machine learning models.MethodsWe analyzed lung cancer
  incidence data (2000â€“2021) from 1,013 US counties. Machine learning models (random
  forest, gradient boosting machine, support vector machine) were trained and optimized
  on the training data. We also employed time series, a linear regression model, and
  DMD for comparison. All models were evaluated based on their ability to predict
  2021 lung cancer incidence rates.ResultsThe time series model achieved the lowest
  root mean squared error, followed by random forest. Meanwhile, DMD had an RMSE similar
  to that of Random Forest. Nearly all counties in Kentucky had higher lung cancer
  incidence rates, while states like California, New Mexico, Utah, and Idaho showed
  lower trends.ConclusionIn summary, DMD offers a promising alternative for public
  health professionals to capture underlying trends and potentially have lower computational
  demands compared to other machine learning models.
