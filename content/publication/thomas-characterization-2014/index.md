abstract: This work focuses on the characterization of particle delivery in microcirculation
  through a microfluidic device. In microvasculature the vessel size is comparable
  to that of red blood cells (RBCs) and the existence of blood cells largely influences
  the dispersion and binding distribution of drug loaded particles. The geometry of
  the microvasculature leads to non-uniform particle distribution and affects the
  particle binding characteristics. We perform an in vitro study in a microfluidic
  chip with micro vessel mimicking channels having a rectangular cross section. Various
  factors that influence particle distribution and delivery such as the vessel geometry,
  shear rate, blood cells, particle size, particle antibody density are considered
  in this study. Around 10% higher particle binding density is observed at bifurcation
  regions of the mimetic microvasculature geometry compared to straight regions. Particle
  binding density is found to decrease with increased shear rates. RBCs enhance particle
  binding for both 210nm and 2μm particles for shear rates between 200−1600s−1 studied.
  The particle binding density increases about 2−3 times and 6−10 times when flowing
  in whole blood at 25% RBC concentration compared to the pure particle case, for
  210nm and 2μm particles respectively. With RBCs, the binding enhancement is more
  significant for 2μm particles than that for 210nm particles, which indicates an
  enhanced size dependent exclusion of 2μm particles from the channel centre to the
  cell free layer (CFL). Increased particle antibody coating density leads to higher
  particle binding density for both 210nm and 2μm particles.
