 abstract = {The traditional finite element method (FEM) has limitations in accurately modeling crack propagation. Peridynamics, a nonlocal extension of the classical continuum theory, provides an alternative approach to remedy the limitations of the FEM but with a higher computational cost. In this paper, a peridynamic bond-based fatigue damage model is developed and incorporated into a commercial finite-element software (ABAQUS 2017) via user subroutines. Model-predicted results including the crack path spatial position and the damage accumulation rate were validated against empirical data. The predicted crack growth as a function of loading cycle and crack trajectory showed good agreement with the experimental data over 200,000 loading cycles. Therefore, the integration of the peridynamic bond-based fatigue damage model into existing FEM software provides an economical means to simulate complex fracture behaviors, such as crack growth, in a compact tension specimen examined in this paper.},
