abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) simulations on blood flow in a complex patient-specific
  retina vascular network were performed considering deformable red blood cells, white
  blood cells (WBCs), and obstructed vessels. First, the impact of blockage on flow
  rate distribution (without cells) was investigated. It showed that the blockage
  might change the flow rate significantly on distant vessels that were not directly
  connected with the blocked vessel. The flow rate in some vessels could increase
  up to 1200% due to an obstruction. However, with cells, it showed a fluctuating
  flow pattern, and the cells showed complicated transport behavior at bifurcations.
  Cell accumulation might occur in some bifurcations such as a T-shaped junction that
  eventually led to a physical blockage. The addition of WBCs impacted the local flow
  rate when they were squeezed through a capillary vessel, and the flow rate could
  be decreased up to 32% due to the larger size of WBCs. The simulation of flow under
  stenosis with cells showed that cells could oscillate and become trapped in a vessel
  due to the fluctuating flow. Finally, a reduced order model (ROM) with multiple
  non-Newtonian viscosity models was used to simulate the blood flow in the network.
  Compared with the 3D model, all ROMs reproduced accurate predictions on hematocrit
  and flow rate distribution in the vascular network. Among them, the Fåhræus–Lindqvist
  model was found to be the most accurate one. The work can be used to build a multiscale
  model for blood flow through integration of ROMs and 3D multiphysics models.
