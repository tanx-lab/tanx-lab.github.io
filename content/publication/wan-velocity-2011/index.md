abstract: The isolation and detection of rare circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has been
  one of the focuses of intense research recently. In a microfluidic device, a number
  of factors can influence the enrichment capability of surface-bound probe molecules.
  This article analyzes the important factor of flow velocity in a microfluidic channel.
  The competition of surface-grafted anti-EGFR aptamers to bind the overexpressed
  EGFR on cell membranes against the drag force from the fluid flow is an important
  efficiency determining factor. The flow rate variations are applied both in experiments
  and in simulation models to study their effects on CTC capture efficiency. A mixture
  of mononuclear cells and human Glioblastoma cells is used to isolate cancer cells
  from the cellular flow. The results show interdependence between the adhesion probability,
  isolation efficiency, and flow rate. This work can help in designing flow-through
  lab-on-chip devices that use surface-bound probe affinities against overexpressed
  biomarkers for cell isolation. This work demonstrates that microfluidic based approaches
  have strong potential applications in CTC detection and isolation.
