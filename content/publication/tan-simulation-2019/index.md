abstract: Understanding cell transport and adhesion dynamics under flow is important
  for many biotransport problems. We investigated the influence of cell size, ligand
  coating density, micropost size, and intercellular collisions on circulating tumor
  cell adhesion and transport in microfluidic devices. The cells were modeled as coarse-grained
  cell membranes and the adhesion was modeled as pairwise interacting potentials,
  while the fluid was solved using the lattice Boltzmann method. The coupling between
  the cell and the fluid was achieved through the immersed boundary method. The cell
  showed transient rolling adhesion in high shear regions and firm adhesion in low
  shear regions. The adhesive force for rolling cells on a micropost was increasing
  before the cell reached the crest of the post and then decreasing afterward. The
  adhesive strength for cells increases with ligand coating density. Cell trajectories
  in a microfluidic device with a shifted post design were studied as well. At low
  concentrations, the majority of the cells follow streamlines closely. However, the
  intercellular collision and collision from red blood cells impacted the cell trajectories.
  An L2 norm of textbaretextbar was defined to characterize the difference between
  the cell trajectories and the associated streamlines. It was shown that textbaretextbarL2
  increases with micropost sizes and cell concentrations.
