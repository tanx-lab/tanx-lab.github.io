abstract: Recently, DNA-nanoparticle conjugates have been widely used as building
  blocks for assembling complex nanostructures, due to their programmable recognitions,
  high cellular uptake and enhanced binding capabilities. In this study, a nanoworm
  structure, which can be applied in fields of drug targeting, image probing and thermal
  therapies, has been assembled by DNA-nanoparticle conjugates. Subsequently, its
  mechanical properties have been investigated due to their importance on the structural
  stability, transport and circulations of the nanoworm. Stiffness and strengths of
  the nanoworm under different deformation types are studied by coarse-grained molecular
  dynamics simulations. Effects of temperature, DNA coating density and particle size
  on mechanical properties of nanoworms are also thoroughly investigated. Results
  show that both resistance and strength of the nanoworm are the weakest along the
  axial direction, indicating it is more prone to be ruptured by a stretching force.
  In addition, DNA strands are found to be more important than nanoparticles in determining
  mechanical properties of the nanoworm. Moreover, both strength and resistance in
  regardless of directions are proved to be enhanced by decreasing the temperature,
  raising the DNA coating density and enlarging the particle size. This study is capable
  of serving as guidance for designing nanoworms with optimal mechanical strengths
  for applications.
