abstract: The design of nanoparticle (NP) size, shape and surface chemistry has a
  significant impact on their performance. While the influences of the particle size
  and surface chemistry on drug delivery have been studied extensively, little is
  known about the effect of particle shapes on nanomedicine. In this perspective article,
  we discuss recent progress on the design and fabrication of NPs of various shapes
  and their unique delivery properties. The shapes of these drug carriers play an
  important role in therapeutic delivery processes, such as particle adhesion, distribution
  and cell internalization. We envision that stimuli-responsive NPs, which actively
  change their shapes and other properties, might pave way to the next generation
  of nanomedicine.
