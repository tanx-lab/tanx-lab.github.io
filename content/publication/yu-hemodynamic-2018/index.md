abstract: 'Unlabelled BoxEssentials•Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are generated
  during thrombosis and sepsis.•The effect of hemodynamics on NETosis during sterile
  thrombosis was studied using microfluidics.•Pressure gradients textgreater 70 mmHg
  per mm‐clot across sterile occlusions drive shear‐induced NETosis.•High interstitial
  hemodynamic forces trigger rapid NET release. Summary: Background Neutrophil extracellular
  traps (NETs) are released when neutrophils encounter infectious pathogens, especially
  during sepsis. Additionally, NETosis occurs during venous and arterial thrombosis,
  disseminated intravascular coagulation, and trauma. Objective To determine whether
  hemodynamic forces trigger NETosis during sterile thrombosis. Methods NETs were
  imaged with Sytox Green during microfluidic perfusion of activated factor XII‐inhibited
  or thrombin‐inhibited human whole blood over fibrillar collagen (with or without
  tissue factor). Results For perfusions at initial inlet venous or arterial wall
  shear rates (100 s−1 or 1000 s−1), platelets rapidly accumulated and occluded microchannels
  with subsequent neutrophil infiltration under either flow condition; however, NETosis
  was detected only in the arterial condition. The level of shear‐induced NETs (SINs)
  at 30 min was textgreater 150‐fold higher in the arterial condition in the absence
  of thrombin and textgreater 80‐fold greater in the presence of thrombin than the
  level in the venous condition. With or without thrombin, venous perfusion for 15 min
  generated no NETs, but an abrupt shift‐up to arterial perfusion triggered NETosis
  within 2 min, NETs eventually reaching levels 15 min later that were 60‐fold greater
  than that in microchannels without perfusion shift‐up. SINs contained citrullinated
  histone H3 and myeloperoxidase, and were DNase‐sensitive, but were not blocked by
  inhibitors of platelet–neutrophil adhesion, high‐mobility group protein box 1–receptor
  for advanced glycation end products interaction, cyclooxygenase, ATP/ADP, or peptidylarginine
  deiminase 4. For measured pressure gradients exceeding 70 mmHg per millimeter of
  clot across NET‐generating occlusions to drive interstitial flow, the calculated
  fluid shear stress on neutrophils exceeded the known lytic value of 150 dyne cm−2.
  Conclusions High interstitial hemodynamic forces can drive physically entrapped
  neutrophils to rapidly release NETs during sterile occlusive thrombosis.'
