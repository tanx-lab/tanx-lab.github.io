abstract: Nanodrug-carrier delivery in the blood stream is strongly influenced by
  nanoparticle (NP) dispersion. This paper presents a numerical study on NP transport
  and dispersion in red blood cell (RBC) suspensions under shear and channel flow
  conditions, utilizing an immersed boundary fluid-structure interaction model with
  a lattice Boltzmann fluid solver, an elastic cell membrane model and a particle
  motion model driven by both hydrodynamic loading and Brownian dynamics. The model
  can capture the multiphase features of the blood flow. Simulations were performed
  to obtain an empirical formula to predict NP dispersion rate for a range of shear
  rates and cell concentrations. NP dispersion rate predictions from the formula were
  then compared to observations from previous experimental and numerical studies.
  The proposed formula is shown to accurately predict the NP dispersion rate. The
  simulation results also confirm previous findings that the NP dispersion rate is
  strongly influenced by local disturbances in the flow due to RBC motion and deformation.
  The proposed formula provides an efficient method for estimating the NP dispersion
  rate in modeling NP transport in large-scale vascular networks without explicit
  RBC and NP models.
