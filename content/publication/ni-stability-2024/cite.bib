 abstract = {In maritime channels, seamark is a critical navigation device that provides an aid to identify approximate positions of the sea area. Appropriate mooring strategies during the design and deployment of seamarks are crucial for enhancing their functionality and ensuring safer navigational guidance. Previous research has attempted simulations of buoys with moorings, but without specifically focusing on their stability requirements. This paper investigates the stability of a seamark affected by the waves. Numerical simulations of a seamark with moorings under regular and unsteady wave impacts are conducted to analyze the stability of the seamark. The results showed inclining behaviors of the seamark under the impact of waves. The mooring line ensures the stability of the seamark, allowing periodic motion but not moving away, and this behavior remains consistent regardless of variations in wave height.},
