abstract: In maritime channels, seamark is a critical navigation device that provides
  an aid to identify approximate positions of the sea area. Appropriate mooring strategies
  during the design and deployment of seamarks are crucial for enhancing their functionality
  and ensuring safer navigational guidance. Previous research has attempted simulations
  of buoys with moorings, but without specifically focusing on their stability requirements.
  This paper investigates the stability of a seamark affected by the waves. Numerical
  simulations of a seamark with moorings under regular and unsteady wave impacts are
  conducted to analyze the stability of the seamark. The results showed inclining
  behaviors of the seamark under the impact of waves. The mooring line ensures the
  stability of the seamark, allowing periodic motion but not moving away, and this
  behavior remains consistent regardless of variations in wave height.
