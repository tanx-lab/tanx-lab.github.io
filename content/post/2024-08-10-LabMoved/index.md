Our Lab Has Moved!
<!--more-->
We are excited to share that our research group has recently moved to Binghamton University! This marks an exciting new chapter for our team as we continue our work in **computational modeling**, **Clot Mechanics**, and **multiphysics research**.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to **Northern Illinois University** for their generous support and collaboration over the years.  
The resources, environment, and community there played a key role in shaping our groupâ€™s research and growth.

We look forward to new opportunities, collaborations, and discoveries at Binghamton!
